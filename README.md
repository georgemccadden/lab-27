### Modules

#### `counter.js`
#### `footer.js`
#### `header.js`

###### Tests
The tests were written and tested with Airbnb's "Enzyme" and run with Jest. These tests were specifically for the counter component. The tests covered the incremental and decremental events and if they asserted state changes properly, asserted that state was being transferred to the DOM, and that the DOM then changes as a result. The test suite passed and so did all of the included tests.  

#### Running the app
Code Sandbox automatically runs and renders the application in the browser.
